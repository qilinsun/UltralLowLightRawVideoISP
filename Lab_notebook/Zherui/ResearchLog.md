# Progress
1. Proposed a pipeline of image alignment and denoising
2. Verified block-matching method based on phase correlation with the video from Prof. Bihan Wen
3. Researched noise modeling and calibration, as well as the k-sigma transform to regularize the distribution of pixels

 # todo
 1. Capture raw data ourselves and perform noise calibration accordingly
 2. Test block-matching method with the raw data
 3. Research sparse coding method and dictionary learning for denoising and block merging
