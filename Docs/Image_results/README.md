These images are uploaded as preliminary results currently.  
The 30th and 29th frames are a pair, demonstrating the motion between adjacent frames.  
The 45th and 40th frames are a pair representing the motion during a relatively long period.   
All blocks are matched via phase correlation, and Gaussian White Noise is added to the origin video.
